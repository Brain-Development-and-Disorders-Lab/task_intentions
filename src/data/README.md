# Intentions Game data

The contents of this folder do not include data generated by participants. The data in this folder is imported by the game to populate the options for phase one and phase three.

- **default.csv** is the primary data file used in the game played by participants. It consists of all trials for each phase. Phase two data has not been removed and is ignored by the game, instead retrieving data from the remote source.
- **test.csv** is an abridged version of _default.csv_ used for **testing purposes only**. It consists of four trials for each phase.
