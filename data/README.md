# Data

The contents of this folder do not include data generated by participants. The data in this folder is imported by the game to populate for user selection and enable the model to run.

## CSV Files

- **default.csv** is the primary data file used in the game played by participants. It consists of all trials for each phase. Phase two data has not been removed and is ignored by the game, instead retrieving data from the remote source.
- **test.csv** is an abridged version of _default.csv_ used for **testing purposes only**. It consists of four trials for each phase.

## Packages

This folder contains all R packages and their dependencies to run the model. The packages are structured as a repository, and the WebR runtime is configured to use this repository for package installation. This enables the model to run offline, if configured to do so.

## WebR Runtime

**Version:** 0.4.2

This folder contains the WebR runtime used to run the model. The runtime is configured to use the packages in the `packages` folder.
